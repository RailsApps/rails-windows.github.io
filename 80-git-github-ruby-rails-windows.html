</ul><hr><h3>Git and GitHub</h3>

<p>What is <a href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</a>?</p>

<p>Git is a free and open source distributed version control system.  It features branching and merging that allow you to commit saved work, switch back to where you branched from, apply any number of patches, switch back to where you are experimenting and merge the requests in.  It is a substantial part of how RoR developers are able to share so much information with others.  It also allows you to pull requests from other authors that may be helping you on your project.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> is a code host that houses code from over four million people.  It is 100% completely free to use and you have unlimited public repositories.  However, if you want to have private repositories then you will have to purchase a small plan.  Public repositories mean that anyone can see and clone your work locally.  This is one of the great ways we all share code with one another!  Collaboration is a huge key to open source projects and the success of those projects.  Rails is an open source project that is housed on GitHub.</p>

<p>If you decide you want to use Git and not use GitHub but create and control your own remotely located code host server, I may showcase that in an advanced topic down the road.  I personally use GitHub for public and some private repositories that I collaborate with others on specific projects.  I also have my own remote git server that I use to develop and privatize code with on Rackspace.</p>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/pricing">GitHub</a></h2>

<p>This chapter section is completely voluntary, meaning the decision to participate is your own.  If you do plan on participating, I would start with a simple free account to get used to things.  If you feel that you need a private repository then you can always upgrade later.</p>

<p>Once you visit <a href="https://github.com">GitHub</a> and sign-up or already have an account, let's continue.</p>

<h3>Creating a Public Repository</h3>

<p>Once you sign in you can click on the <strong>New repository</strong> button to create a public repo for your current project. Let's fill some things in together:</p>

<ol>
<li>Add a Repository name, you can call it anything you like so long as it's available.</li>
<li>In the description field, just put in a test application.</li>
<li>Public should be checked.</li>
<li>Click the "Create repository" button.</li>
</ol><p>GitHub should provide you 3 different ways to continue:  Quick Setup, Create a new repository on the command line, or Push an existing repository from the command line. We will be concentrating on the second option for now, creating a new repository from the command line.  Make sure you save or print the instructions that GitHub provides you for reference!</p>

<p>Open Windows Explorer (WIN Key + E on your keyboard) and navigate to the directory you created your application in.  For my example app, the path is C:\Development\Wrails.  I will navigate to the C:\Development directory to begin with.  Once you are in the root of the directory that houses your entire Wrails application folder, do the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>Right-click on your Wrails folder and choose "Git bash".</li>
<li>-&gt; This puts me in my /C/Development/wrails (master) folder</li>
</ul><p>Once here, type the following commands in Git Bash, in order:</p>

<pre>
  $git config --global user.email "yourEmail@example.com"
  $git config --global user.name "Your Name"
  $git config core.autocrlf false
  $touch README.md
  $git init
  $git add README.md
  $git commit -m "first commit"
  $git remote add origin https://github.com/YourAccountName/YourRepositoryName.git
  $git push -u origin master
</pre>

<p>You should be prompted with a username and password box and once you enter the credentials, your push should go through.  In the example above you need to substitute your email and your name.  You also need to put your account name and repo name in the git remote add origin command.</p>

<p>If you refresh your Internet Explorer webpage on GitHub, you should now see your first commit, a simple README file.  Keep your git bash window open and don't close it.  We're going to use it again shortly.</p>

<h4>.gitignore</h4>

<p>Open Sublime and look back in your wrails directory locally and find a file called .gitignore.  It should be in the root of your wrails directory.  Double-click and open it.</p>

<p>This file allows you to ignore which files should not be added to the GitHub repository.  Examples of things you wouldn't want to include would be SQLite database files, specific log files, configuration files that contain application keys or passwords to other social sharing or payment gateway sites.</p>

<p>More importantly, you want to protect your secret_token.rb and database.yml files. Your secret token is used to verify the integrity of signed cookies.  You want to keep this private.  Your database.yml file houses passwords to your database so you want to keep this safe as well.</p>

<p>Add the following at the bottom of your .gitignore file:</p>

<pre>
  /config/initializers/secret_token.rb
  /config/database.yml
</pre>

<p>Save your file and let's try a full application push now.  From git bash:</p>

<pre>
  $git add .   (yes that's a period)
  $git commit -m "full base application push"
  $git push origin master
</pre>

<p>Now do a refresh on GitHub.  Voila!  Your entire app is now stored on GitHub.  But, wait a minute.  If you go and look in your config directory you will see that the database.yml and the config/initializers/secret_token.rb files are not listed.  They were ignored by the .gitignore file.  Great!</p>

<p>There are a lot of interesting things you can choose to ignore in your public repository.  Later on you may want to exclude any Sublime
 workspace or project files.  You may want to exclude any custom folders you create.</p>

<p>Close your git bash shell and let's move on.</p>

<h3><a href="http://windows.github.com/">GitHub for Windows</a></h3>

<p>And lo and behold, an application came down from the mighty GitHub mountain and its name was <a href="http://windows.github.com/">GitHub Windows</a>.  Its claim?  The easiest way to use GitHub on Windows.  We have to try this out! That's why VMs are so much fun.  Let's download and install it.  Now, if you were following from either the automated or manual installations, I conveniently left this application out.  I wanted us to experience it together.  After you download it, install it using all default locations it provides.</p>

<p>When the application is finished installing, type in your GitHub username or email address and your password and log in.  Click Continue. Click the dashboard link to get started.  Now the first thing you may notice is that it says there are no repositories.  If you double-click on your username below local repositories you'll see all of your "remote" repositories on GitHub.  Click on repositories under local to show that you have no repos yet.  Go to your Windows explorer and drag your wrails folder locally on top of the "drag here" in GitHub Windows.  You just added your first local repository.</p>

<h4>Local Repositories - Wrails</h4>

<p>Double-click your user/wrails repository in GitHub Windows.  You should see the commits you made earlier on the left hand side, the commit to the right and some sync/master/settings buttons on the upper right corner.  Take a moment to look over things.  Once you are finished, continue on.</p>

<p>Go back into Sublime and look at your application root again.  Right-click and delete the README.rdoc file in your app.  Once deleted, go back to GitHub Windows and click the drop down on the upper left for uncommitted changes.  Type "deleted readme.rdoc" in the Commit Message and then click the checkmark next to "commit to master".  Look up in the right hand corner of GitHub Windows and you'll notice there's a numerical 1 next to sync.  Click the Sync button now.  Wait for it... Tada!!</p>

<h3>Git on PowerShell</h3>

<p>Before we start using PowerShell scripting with Git, here's what you'll need to begin:</p>

<ul>
<li>Clone <a href="https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git">posh-git</a> to a local folder.  For me, it's the C:\Development directory.</li>
<li>C:\Development&gt; git clone <a href="https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git.git">https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git.git</a>
</li>
<li>From the posh-git repository directory, run .\install.ps1 (* read notes first!)</li>
</ul><pre>
If you've already created and worked with your PowerShell $profile, you do not want to run the install.ps1 script above.

Instead, you can open your profile by typing:

  PS C:\&gt; notepad $profile

  Once your script is opened, put the following code at the top of the profile:

  # Load posh-git example profile
  . 'C:\Development\posh-git\profile.example.ps1'

Make sure the path is reflective of your install directory for posh-git.

Otherwise, if you haven't used PS $profile yet, run the install.ps1 script and continue reading.
</pre>

<p>We haven't gone into PowerShell scripting yet, at least not extensively.  One of the interesting things that this script will do is it will access your
$profile which can house things like including PS scripts when PS is launched, custom functions, custom aliases, and custom code.  Normally you have to
create this $profile but the posh-git script just did it for you.</p>

<p>Navigate to the posh-git directory and open profile.example.ps1.  Let's comment out the Start-SshAgent -Quiet and replace it:</p>

<pre>
  # Start-SshAgent -Quiet
  Start-SshAgent
</pre>

<p>Edit and modify your existing path to include the git\bin directory</p>

<pre>
  $path = $env:path+='C:\Program Files\Git\bin'
  [Environment]::SetEnvironmentVariable("Path", $path, "User")
</pre>

<p>You may be asking why we didn't use Setx or something shorter.  It's helpful to learn PS scripting and how you can do the same thing through a scripting
language.  Using $env:Path on its own would not make the path persistent so once you closed the window the path would be gone.  As a quick explanation for
our code above:</p>

<pre>
  $path = our current environment path + ;The path we want to append
  The SetEnvironmentVariable("from our path", "to our new path", "and add it to our User profile")

  You could use Machine, Process, or User with SetEnvironmentVariable.
</pre>

<p>Once you've read and followed these instructions, <strong>close and reopen</strong> PowerShell.  Navigate to our project directory for wrails.  I have a commit pending so
mine shows:</p>

<pre>
  C:\Development\wrails [master +0 ~1 -0]
</pre>

<p>This means that I'm already in the master checkout and so I can commit when ready.  If you have any commits or don't know, try it anyways:</p>

<pre>
  git add -A
  git commit -m 'testing posh-git'
  git push origin master
</pre>

<pre>
C:\Development\wrails [master +0 ~1 -0]&gt; git add -A
C:\Development\wrails [master +0 ~1 -0]&gt; git commit -m 'testing posh-git'
[master 286a408] testing posh-git

C:\Development\wrails [master]&gt;
</pre>

<p>As you can see above, I was prompted for my username and password.  I would rather use SSH keys.  In fact, if you installed Github for Windows, you'll notice
that you probably received an email from Github saying that a new set of ssh keys were automatically added.  So, in actuality we should be able to use ssh
with git.  Try the new origin below but replace with your account name:</p>

<pre>
  git remote set-url origin ssh://git@github.com/YourAccount/wrails.git
</pre>

<p>Let's do some generic testing and troubleshooting.  You should know how to do this for future reasons:</p>

<pre>
# First test using a verify test to git@github.com
ssh -vT git@github.com
</pre>

<p>You should see that it prompts you for RSA host key and it also goes into a debug session.  You may even see a Permission denied (publickey) in the debug
session.  Look it over and see what it was testing.  You should see that it tried to authenticate with publickey.</p>

<pre>
debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey
debug1: Next authentication method: publickey
debug1: Trying private key: /c/Users/IEUser/.ssh/identity
debug1: Trying private key: /c/Users/IEUser/.ssh/id_rsa
debug1: Trying private key: /c/Users/IEUser/.ssh/id_dsa
debug1: No more authentication methods to try.
Permission denied (publickey).
C:\Development\wrails [master]&gt;
</pre>

<p>But, wait a minute.  Notice it said it's looking for .ssh/id_rsa?  Go look in your c/Users/IEUser/.ssh/ directory and you'll probably see that github for
windows made an github_rsa and a github_rsa.pub file but not one for id_rsa.  Now we could use ssh-add to add the github_ key but we'd have to do this every
time.  We could create a config file that houses multiple git profiles and you could then type the git config you want to use before connecting.</p>

<p>However, in this case since we are going to be using the same keys, I'll just copy and paste them in the same directory and then right-click and rename them
to id_rsa and id_rsa.pub.  This way I have two identical sets of keys (one usable by PowerShell and one usable by Github for Windows).  No scripting is involved.</p>

<p>Try tesing after you do that:</p>

<pre>
ssh -vT git@github.com

Outputs:

debug1: Authentications that can continue: publickey
debug1: Next authentication method: publickey
debug1: Trying private key: /c/Users/IEUser/.ssh/identity
debug1: Offering public key: /c/Users/IEUser/.ssh/id_rsa
debug1: Server accepts key: pkalg ssh-rsa blen 277
debug1: read PEM private key done: type RSA
debug1: Authentication succeeded (publickey).
debug1: channel 0: new [client-session]

Hi elricstorm! You've successfully authenticated, but GitHub does not provide shell access.
</pre>

<p>Hey, that's better.  It at least knows who I am now but it says it does not provide shell access.  What the heck does that mean?  Don't worry, it means nothing.
You can safely ignore that error.  Now try re-pushing something again.</p>

<pre>
  git add -A
  git commit -m 'testing posh-git'
  git push origin master
</pre>

<p>Yay, everything up to date!  GitHub has its own set of configuration routines, troubleshooting, etc.  Don't feel bad if this was a little nerve wracking to get
setup.  The point I'm making is this is not a windows thing and that it happens to Linux and Mac users too!</p>

<p>However, I like speed and PowerShell offers great speed with scripting.  Now I'm going to teach you how to create a nifty script to publish everything, including
providing you the ability to create a custom commit message.  See PowerShell Aliases below.</p>

<h4>PowerShell Aliases</h4>

<p>In powershell open your $profile by typing "notepad $profile".</p>

<p>This profile should already house the posh-git script pointer but we're going to add some scripting of our own.  Copy and paste the following into your $profile
right below posh-git:</p>

<pre>
function publish-wrails {
  $wrails_dir = "C:\Development\wrails"
  cd $wrails_dir
  # Push to Wrails
  echo "__________________________________________________________________"
  echo "===&gt; COMMITTING to Wrails"
  echo "_____________________USER INPUT REQUIRED!_________________________"
  $commit = Read-Host 'Please type your commit message...'
  git add -A
  git commit -m $commit
  git push origin master
  echo "... FINISHED Pushing to Wrails";
}
sal pubwrails publish-wrails
</pre>

<p>Edit the $wrails_dir path to point to where your directory is located.  Once finished, close and reopen PowerShell.  Type the following:</p>

<pre>
C:\Users\IEUser&gt; pubwrails

# When prompted for the commit message type "test commit"
</pre>

<p>It couldn't be simpler than that.  From now on, while you are working and saving your project, just type pubwrails from the command line, add a commit
message and continue on.  One word. :)</p>

<h2>Summary</h2>

<p>I know this section was rather long but I hope it helped you understand how to use Git.  So, which one do <strong>you</strong> want to use?  Hey, that's up to you.  You
can right-click and use Git Gui, or Git Bash.  You can use GitHub Windows if you prefer that option.  Or, you can even access Git through PowerShell
scripting.  The point is, you have choices and options.  You decide and make the final word!</p>

<h2>Next Steps</h2>

<p>If you're new to Rails, see <a href="http://railsapps.github.io/what-is-ruby-rails.html">What is Ruby on Rails?</a>, the book <a href="http://learn-rails.com/learn-ruby-on-rails.html">Learn Ruby on Rails</a>, and recommendations for a <a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org/rails-tutorial">Rails tutorial</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://learn-rails.com/learn-ruby-on-rails.html" title="Learn Ruby on Rails"><img src="http://railsapps.github.io/images/learn-rails-cover-130x161.jpg" width="130" height="161" alt="Learn Ruby on Rails"></a></p>

<p>The <a href="http://railsapps.github.io/">RailsApps project</a> provides example applications that developers use as starter apps. Hundreds of developers use the apps, report problems as they arise, and propose solutions. Rails changes frequently; each application is known to work and serves as your personal "reference implementation" so you can stay up to date. Each is accompanied by a tutorial so there is no mystery code. Support for the project, including the example applications and the <a href="http://railsapps.github.io/rails-composer/">Rails Composer</a> tool, comes from subscribers to the <a href="https://tutorials.railsapps.org">RailsApps tutorials</a>.</p>
