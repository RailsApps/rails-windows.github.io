</ul><hr><h3>Software You'll Need</h3>

<p>Before continuing you should make sure you have all of the tools necessary to continue with the tutorials and documentation.  All of the utilities for the tutorials are free to download and free to use, with the exception of Sublime Text 3 should you use that as your editor.  Here is a list of recommended software:</p>

<ul>
<li><em><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=30653">.NET Framework 4.5</a></em></li>
<li>PowerShell 2.0 or higher (recommended PS 4.0)</li>
<li>Windows 7 or Windows 8 or Windows 8.1 (see <a href="http://rails-windows.github.io/40-virtual-machines-ruby-rails-windows.html">Virtual Machines for Ruby on Rails on Windows</a>)</li>
<li><em><a href="http://www.7-zip.org/download.html">7zip</a></em></li>
<li>
<em><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">VirtualBox</a></em> (if you plan on installing a VM)</li>
<li>Text Editor (recommended <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text 3</a>)</li>
</ul><p>That should get you started initially.  If you plan on doing manual installations later on, you can look at the pre-requisites in <a href="http://rails-windows.github.io/60-manual-install-ruby-rails-windows.html">Manual Installation for Ruby on Rails on Windows</a>.  Otherwise,
no other software is required.  If you decide you don't want to use Sublime Text 3 but still want a solid free code editor, I recommend
<a href="http://www.scintilla.org/SciTE.html">SciTE</a>.</p>

<h3>Setting Expectations</h3>

<p>The topics we will discuss here are:</p>

<ul>
<li>References and Definition Summaries</li>
<li>VirtualBox</li>
<li>Structuring and Organizing your Development Area</li>
<li>IDE and Text Editors</li>
<li>Handling Proxies</li>
</ul><h3>References and Definitions</h3>

<h4><em><a href="http://www.nuget.org/">NuGet</a></em></h4>

<p>Towards mid-2010, the .NET community was introduced to OpenWrap, immediately followed by a Microsoft announcement
that they joined forces with a .NET package management project called Nubular (Nu). Based on RubyGems, it was
rewritten to remove the Ruby dependency. The Nu command line package management system was now to be called
NuPack. It was eventually rebranded to NuGet.</p>

<p>NuGet is the open source package manager for the Microsoft development platform including .NET.  When you use NuGet to install
a package, it copies the library files to your solution and automatically updates your project
(adds references, change config files, etc.). If you remove a package, NuGet reverses whatever changes it made so
that no clutter is left.</p>

<p>You can develop your own package and share it via the NuGet Gallery.</p>

<h4><em><a href="http://www.chocolatey.org/">Chocolatey</a></em></h4>

<p>Chocolatey is the equivallent of a package manager for Windows, similar to using apt-get for Linux.  It uses
Windows Powershell and the .NET framework to allow you to silently install many different applications
seamlessly.  When a package has an .exe file, chocolatey will create a link "shortcut" to the file so that you
can run that tool anywhere on the machine.  When a package has a chocolateyInstall.ps1 script in it, the script
will be run instead.  The limitations of what can be run is defined only by the .NET framework version and
by PowerShell.</p>

<p>Chocolatey.org houses over 1,400 unique packages (at the time of this writing) and is growing tremendously.  It
houses a huge amount of core development components and applications, some of which we will be using for our
installation.</p>

<h4><em><a href="http://rubyinstaller.org/">RubyInstaller and DevKit</a></em></h4>

<p>The <b>RubyInstaller</b> project provides a self-contained Windows-based installer that houses the Ruby language
execution environment, a baseline set of required RubyGems and extensions, and the full text of the wonderful
book, The Book of Ruby.  The Ruby Installer is currently available only for the Windows platform.</p>

<p>One of the challenges many Ruby on Windows users have is how to easily use native RubyGems from the community
such as the rdiscount or curb gems. In many cases this isn’t a problem because the extension author has
provided a binary gem compatible with the users Ruby environment. In other cases, only the extension source
code is available in the gem and the user is expected to have a “sane” environment installed and configured
in order to build and use the native gem. A “sane” environment typically means a system with make, gcc, sh
and similar *nix build tools installed.</p>

<p>This expectation of a “sane” build environment is not always true for Windows users and is the primary reason
why the <b>DevKit</b> was created. The DevKit, based upon MSYS and MinGW components, is an easy-to-install and
easy-to-use solution for quickly setting up a “sane” build environment, enabling you to use most native
RubyGems developed by the Ruby community.</p>

<p>The DevKit is used to build MRI Ruby and the required dependencies needed to deliver the RubyInstaller for
Windows. Many community members also use the DevKit as their “foundation” toolkit for building other
native software.  The DevKit is currently available for download as a self-extracting archive and a
Windows installer is in development.</p>

<h4><em><a href="http://boxstarter.org/">Boxstarter</a></em></h4>

<p>Boxstarter leverages Chocolatey packages to automate the installation of software and create repeatable,
scripted Windows environments. Chocolatey makes installing software very easy with no user
intervention. Boxstarter enhances Chocolatey's functionality and provides an environment that is optimized
for installing a complete environment on a fresh OS install as well as some other specific scenarios.</p>

<p>For an example boxstarter web script, see the rails4stack.ps1 script located in the PowerShell directory.</p>

<h4><em><a href="https://bitbucket.org/jonforums/uru/">URU</a></em></h4>

<p>Uru is a lightweight, multi-platform command line tool that helps you use the multiple
rubies (currently MRI, JRuby, and Rubinius) on your 32/64-bit Linux, OS X, or Windows systems. Uru is
a micro-kernel. It provides a core set of minimal complexity, multi-platform ruby use enhancers.</p>

<h4><em><a href="http://railsapps.github.io/">Rails Examples and Tutorials</a></em></h4>

<p>This is a website and GitHub repository for open source Ruby on Rails example applications.</p>

<p>The example applications include Ruby on Rails introductions for beginners as well as examples for
experienced developers. Each application is accompanied by a detailed tutorial. Support for the
project, including the example applications and helpful free articles, comes from subscribers to the
RailsApps tutorials.</p>

<hr><h3><a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/">VirtualBox</a></h3>

<p>VirtualBox is a cross-platform virtualization application. What does that mean? For one thing, it installs on your existing Intel or AMD-based computers operating system. Secondly, it extends the capabilities of your existing computer so that it can run multiple operating systems (inside multiple virtual machines) at the same time. So, for example, you can run Windows 8, Windows 8.1 preview, and even Linux on your Windows PC, all alongside your existing applications. You can install and run as many virtual machines as you like -- the only practical limits are disk space and memory.</p>

<p>VirtualBox is free and the binaries are released under the terms of the GPL version 2 license.  Visit the <a href="https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads">downloads</a> section to find the latest platform package for Windows hosts.</p>

<p>If you plan to not utilize virtualization in development, you can skip the download and install of VirtualBox.</p>

<p>Once installed you can read up on using VirtualBox by accessing the <a href="http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/virtualbox/4.3.4/UserManual.pdf">User Manual</a>.  We will go over VirtualBox more in Chapter 3.</p>

<h3>Structuring and Organizing your Development Area</h3>

<p>Before beginning any new development project it is important to determine the layout and structure of your working area.</p>

<h5>Virtual or Local</h5>

<p>VMs have their advantages.  The ability to build an environment in minutes, test or isolate application scenarios, and then break it all down in moments can be a
wonderful thing. VMs operate independently and don't affect any local configurations at all.  If you plan on staying with a simple structured environment with very
few base changes, you may decide to keep a local non-virtual environment.  If you plan on setting up a VM see <a href="http://rails-windows.github.io/40-virtual-machines-ruby-rails-windows.html">Virtual Machines for Ruby on Rails on Windows</a> and
then come back here.  Otherwise, let's continue on.</p>

<h3>Design your environment on paper</h3>

<p>Sometimes the simplest approach to deciding where things are going to go and how things will work is just to take out a piece of paper and start writing your ideas down as a form of questions.</p>

<h6>Questioning and Setting Your Own Expectations</h6>

<pre>
    \&gt; Are you planning on developing GUI tools or other apps with Ruby by itself?
    \&gt; Are you planning to only use ruby on rails and work with web development?
    \&gt; If web development is your focus, what type of stack do you want to build?
    \&gt; Are there any special dependencies you need for your development stack?
    \&gt; What editor or IDE do you want to use when coding or developing?
    \&gt; Do you plan on using a VM for virtual developing?
    \&gt; How do you plan on handling versioning and backups?
    \&gt; If using databases, what type of database management system will you use?
</pre>

<p>This is a very simple list of questions that help you determine what things you may want to consider.  For instance, if you plan on developing GUI apps at some point, you might want to check out WxRuby widgets. You also may want to have a GitHub account for backing up and handling versioning.  Try to focus on core components and ideas pertaining to how you develop.  The pieces you need later to complete your website can be saved for another time.</p>

<p>You may want to also organize a checklist:</p>

<ul>
<li>[x] Install and use VirtualBox for VM management</li>
<li>[x] Install and use a Windows 8.1 VM</li>
<li>[x] Configure Windows PowerShell</li>
<li>[ ] Install and use Chocolatey and NuGet for package management</li>
<li>[ ] Install Ruby 2.0 using Chocolatey</li>
<li>[ ] Install Rails 4.x using Chocolatey</li>
<li>[ ] Install Uru for managing Ruby environments</li>
<li>[ ] Install MySQL using Chocolatey for my Database Management</li>
<li>[ ] Install and use Msysgit and GitHub</li>
<li>[x] Install and use Sublime Text 3 as my code editor</li>
<li>[ ] Set Windows Environment Paths for Ruby Path Extensions</li>
<li>[ ] Set Windows Environment Paths for Gems</li>
<li>[ ] Set Windows Environment Paths for Chocolatey</li>
</ul><p>You don't have to do anything right now.  This is just an example list.  You may also want to determine if you would like to setup your directory structures a certain way.  Maybe you'd like everything that is tool related to automatically go in C:\tools\bin, or you might want to have a development library setup in C:\Development.</p>

<p>Take a few minutes to determine what you want.  If you don't know then you may want to <strong>embrace the stack</strong>.</p>

<h6>Embracing the Stack</h6>

<p>Don't know what you want?  That's fine.  Start with a default stack that someone else created for you.  A stack can be a number of items that form a working environment.  An example stack might be:</p>

<ul>
<li>Windows 8.1</li>
<li>Ruby 2.0</li>
<li>Rails 4.0</li>
<li>Mongrel</li>
<li>RubyMine IDE</li>
<li>MongoDB</li>
<li>Rspec | Cucumber Testing</li>
</ul><p>This is just a base example.  You start with someone else's idea in a VM test environment, play with it, get to know it, and then decide what you like the most.  You can then test other stacks until you find a good mix and match of development style that fits your own.  Then create your own stack!  This is one reason why a VM may be one of the best options to go as it provides very good flexibility.</p>

<h3>IDE or Text Editors</h3>

<p>An IDE normally consists of a source code editor, build automation tools and a debugger. Several modern IDEs integrate with Intelli-sense coding features.  Editors are standard
text or code editors that may or may not do additional tasks.  You could call some of the fancier editors hybrid IDE applications.  Some IDEs that are usable on Windows
include RubyMine and Netbeans.  Both of these IDEs have extreme load times and tend to bottleneck resources.</p>

<p>For our tutorials I recommend <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/3">Sublime Text 3</a>.  It is a very sophisticated and extremely easy to use editor that has very little resource usage.</p>

<div class="panel callout radius">
  <h5>NOTE:</h5>
  <p>If you plan on using a VM, you can come back to these instructions after you've created your VM and installed Sublime Text 3 on it instead.  Otherwise, if
    you're doing this locally and without a VM you can finish the setup configuration below:</p>
</div>

<p>After you have Sublime text 3 downloaded and running, do the following:</p>

<p>Setup Package Control.</p>

<pre><code> Click CTRL + ~
</code></pre>

<p>Copy and Paste the following below into the console and hit enter.</p>

<pre>
import urllib.request,os; pf = 'Package Control.sublime-package'; ipp = sublime.installed_packages_path(); urllib.request.install_opener( urllib.request.build_opener( urllib.request.ProxyHandler()) ); open(os.path.join(ipp, pf), 'wb').write(urllib.request.urlopen( 'http://sublime.wbond.net/' + pf.replace(' ','%20')).read())
</pre>

<p>Close and restart Sublime Text 3.  Next, let's add some packages to make it look more friendly:</p>

<pre>
     Click Preferences &gt; Package Control &gt; Install Package
     Type Soda theme and click to install.
     .. repeat and type RailsCasts color and click to install this theme.
     .. repeat and type All Autocomplete and click to install.
     .. repeat and type BeautifyRuby and click to install.
     .. repeat and type Better Coffeescript and click to install.
     .. repeat and type ChangeQuotes and click to install.
     .. repeat and type SideBarEnhancements and click to install.
     .. repeat and type GitGutter and click to install.
</pre>

<p>Edit your user preferences:</p>

<pre><code> Click Preferences &gt; Settings-User
</code></pre>

<p>Copy and paste in the settings from <a href="http://elricstorm.viewdocs.io/rails-for-windows/sublime-preferences">sublime-preferences</a>.  Also, you may want to change/edit the ignored words.  I threw in a couple of words for fun.</p>

<p>Next, download the <a href="http://www.levien.com/type/myfonts/inconsolata.html">Inconsolata font</a>.  It's a great font for developing and coding.  Use the .otf version and once you download it, just click and install it.  It's that easy.  Now then, restart Sublime text 3 and you should see everything looks pretty solid.  Good job!</p>

<h5><a href="http://foundation.zurb.com/">Zurb Foundation</a></h5>

<p>If you are planning on using Zurb Foundation in your rails project, I would recommend importing some of foundation's Sublime 3 snippets:</p>

<p>From a cmd prompt:</p>

<pre>
    cd "%AppData%\Sublime Text 3\Packages\User"
    git clone https://github.com/zurb/foundation-5-sublime-snippets.git
</pre>

<ul>
<li>Each snippet is prefixed with zf- (ZURB Foundation).</li>
<li>Each snippet is singular, unless the name of the component ends in an s (offcanvas)</li>
<li>Available classes are included as comments in the snippets</li>
</ul><p>Available Components Offcanvas:</p>

<pre>
    zf-topbar + tab
    zf-sidenav + tab
    zf-subnav + tab
    zf-breadcrumb + tab
    zf-pagination + tab
    zf-orbit + tab
    zf-clearing + tab
    zf-button + tab
    zf-button-group + tab
    zf-split-button + tab
    zf-dropdown-button + tab
    zf-reveal + tab
    zf-alert + tab
    zf-panel + tab
    zf-pricing-table + tab
    zf-progress-bar + tab
    zf-accordion + tab
    zf-tab + tab
    zf-vertical-tab + tab
</pre>

<p>Once imported, restart Sublime and then go to Tools &gt; Snippets.  Type in <strong>zf</strong> to see a full list of foundation quick actions.  These will allow you to quickly create foundation classes.  Test it out in an erb or html file.</p>

<h3>Handling Proxies</h3>

<p>If you are operating behind a proxy (at work for example) and encounter any type of download/setup issue going forward, you may need to add a proxy to your local path.  To
add a proxy, do the following from an elevated CMD prompt as an administrator:</p>

<pre>
    C:\&gt; setx HTTP_PROXY "http://yourproxy:port" (ex: ascproxy:80)
    C:\&gt; setx HTTPS_PROXY "https://yourproxy:port" (use instead of HTTP if your work is using HTTPS)
</pre>
